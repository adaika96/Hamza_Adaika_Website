I am currently working as an ML Engineer at TEKsystems (HP R&D), Bangalore, India. Prior to joining TEKsystems, I worked at MachineSense, Kolkata, India. Before that, I was a PhD student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at IIT Kharagpur, India. My PhD research was focused on [machinery fault diagnosis](https://biswajitsahoo1111.github.io/cbm_codes_open/) and [prognosis](https://biswajitsahoo1111.github.io/rul_codes_open/) using deep learning. At IIT Kharagpur, I was advised by [Prof. A. R. Mohanty](https://www.iitnoise.com/). During my PhD, I developed an interest in machine learning and deep learning in particular. Though my training is in mechanical engineering, I have acquired machine learning skills by self-study and from MOOCs through [online certifications](https://www.linkedin.com/in/biswajitsahoo1111/). Beyond research, I like literature and music.
